#  m1necraft

Minecraft, compiled natively for macOS.

The main reason for building this was really just to put Swift to good use. I've read about it but never really had the chance to use it.

### Credits

The inspiration for this came from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/tanmayb123/d55b16c493326945385e815453de411a).

[PatrikTheDev](https://twitter.com/PatrikTheDev) helped me a ton with SwiftUI and just Swift in general.
