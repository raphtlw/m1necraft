### [Installation Steps](https://raph.codes/projects/m1necraft)

‚òùÔ∏è

Run Minecraft natively on Apple Silicon, easily.
Optimizations to the Minecraft installation are also pre-configured to give you the best performance and stability.
Everything from the launcher to the actual game is optimized well enough such that you can literally just launch and play.

Mods are supported with this, just like the original game.

The code is seperated into 3 parts: API, GUI, CLI.

#### API

A unit-testable API that encapsulates all the core functions of the program. It gives the GUI the same functionality as the CLI.

#### GUI

A graphical interface that makes use of the macOS Cocoa APIs to show a nice UI that users can use to interface with the application.

#### CLI

A command line interface, very useful for testing and automating the functionality of the program.

## Build instructions

You'll have to run `cargo build --bin m1necraft`, where bin should specify which binary you want to run, or just run `cargo build` to build everything.
