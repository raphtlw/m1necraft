### [Installation Steps](https://raph.codes/projects/m1necraft)

☝️

Run Minecraft natively on Apple Silicon, easily.
Optimizations to the Minecraft installation are also pre-configured to give you the best performance and stability.
Everything from the launcher to the actual game is optimized well enough such that you can literally just launch and play.

Mods are supported with this, just like the original game.

### Installation

To install this, open the Terminal app (hit command+space and then search for it), and then paste the following into the terminal:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphtlw/m1necraft/main/installer/install.sh | bash
```

<!-- TODO: write notes about code structure -->

## Developer instructions

### Build instructions

To build m1necraft, open the project in Xcode and build.

### Creating releases

In this repository, releases are automatically built and published when a new tag is created. Create a new Git tag, push it, and a new release will automatically be built.

After the new tag has been pushed, you'll also need to update the Homebrew formula.
Increment the version in the tarball URL and push the changes.
